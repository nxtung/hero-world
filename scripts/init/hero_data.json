Alan Scott is the first to bear the name Green Lantern, wielding a ring that focuses a mystical green flame. He was one of the first to put on a cape, becoming a founding member of the Justice Society of America. As time passed and Alan aged, he evolved into a mentor and inspiration to generations of new superheroes. Recharging his ring through his magic lantern, Green Lantern made his emerald glow a sign of hope and source of inspiration for decades.  Across the multiverse, on Earth-2, another Alan Scott wields the green flame after a tragic loss. This Green Lantern is the avatar of the Green, the elemental force that controls all living growth on Earth and focuses his powers through a ring meant for his dead partner. No less powerful or compelling than his earlier counterpart, he glows green to banish evil and help restore a war-torn world to its former greatness.",

Alfred Pennyworth is more than just Bruce Wayne’s butler, or Batman’s confidant. Alfred is a second father to Wayne, and serves as his conscience when the never-ending fight against evil wears on the Caped Crusader. Pennyworth keeps the Bat-Family together through his compassion and leadership. He has not only raised Bruce Wayne, but also the four young men who have worn the mask of Robin, the Boy Wonder: Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and now, Damian Wayne.  As a former British intelligence officer, field medic and trained Shakespearean actor, Alfred is uniquely suited to support the lives of masked crime fighters. He's quick with a disguise, a cover story, an alibi; and quicker still with a suture, a cast or an ice bath. He ensures that Wayne Manor—all of Wayne Manor, including the vast Batcave—is operating at peak performance while the Bat-Family patrols the city. Plus, he makes a mean cucumber sandwich, which may not be something he lists on his resume, but is certainly something everyone who sets foot on the manor's grounds will fondly remember.",

They demand equality and oppose corruption. Sometimes though, it's more than just standing against the establishment. Sometimes, in order to combat corruption, it’s better to abolish the establishment completely and let anarchy reign.  Highly intelligent and deeply philosophical, Lonnie Machin developed a strong ethical and apolitical code. Looking at the world around him, he saw corruption, social oppression and the suffering of everyday people—and saw the government doing nothing about it. Taking a cue from the Dark Knight, Machin studied martial arts and put his engineering abilities and knowledge of computer technology to use to become a vigilante himself: Anarky. Although he thinks of himself as a hero like Batman and believes anarchy would help the people help themselves, Batman views Anarky's methods and actions as childish and violent, and considers Anarky a public threat, plain and simple.  Anarky uses his abilities to bring down any corporation or authoritative entity that he feels hurts and oppresses people. While he can throw a punch as well as anyone, he relies primarily on his thorough understanding of modern technology to defeat his foes along with the very essence of anarchy itself—surprise.",

But Antiope is known for more than just her skill in battle.

Following one such denouncement, Antiope left the island and fell in love with Theseus, son of Hercules. Together, they settled into what would eventually become Bana-Mighdall, home of a splinter group of Amazons that would include the warrior Artemis.

Atlanna is a member of the Royal House of Atlantis, the undersea kingdom which would later famously be ruled by her son Arthur, the superhero known as Aquaman. As a young princess, she was prone to adventuring and wandering dangerously close to the ocean's surface. One night, while swimming close to land, she encountered a terrible storm and found a damaged lifeboat carrying a surface dwelling human named Tom Curry. The man’s ship had capsized, thus throwing him overboard to his likely demise. Atlanna saved Curry and nursed him back to health, and the two would later fall in love and eventually marry. She would have his child, a boy the couple named Arthur.",

After retiring from his heroic life, he embarked on a career in physics.  Ray Palmer, research scientist, created a “white dwarf lens” that gave him control over his own mass and size. As the Atom, he fought many villains and strange menaces across time and space, not only alone but also as a member of the Justice League. For a brief time, Ray Palmer went undercover and a man named Adam Cray stood in as the Atom.  Born and raised in Hong Kong, Lun “Ryan” Choi studied under Ray Palmer at Ivy University. After a year, Ryan was told a life-changing secret: Ray Palmer was the superhero known as the Atom. For the next couple of years, Ryan aided the Atom’s activities. When Palmer vanished one day, he left behind a spare size-changing belt with its own dwarf star lens for Ryan to use. As the new Atom, Ryan fights to protect people just as his mentor did and serves as a member of the Justice League of America.",

Any form Gar happens to take will also be completely green, no matter what. So much for being able to blend in.  Luckily, fading into the background has never been Gar’s goal in life. When he’s not using his powers to be a superhero, he spends his time as an amateur actor and social butterfly, winning friends and “adoring fans” (at least, in his head) wherever he goes.

Instead, she lives up to her name with her awe-inspiring height and power as well as the impact she leaves on her enemies.  Taken from her mother at an early age, Barda grew up on Apokolips in Granny Goodness's \"Orphanage\" where she was trained in the art of battle. Barda relished fighting and enjoyed besting anyone that challenged her. Her sheer power and unparalleled skills in combat quickly made her the most feared Apokoliptian warrior of all time—an incredible feat to accomplish on a world that bred the most terrifying, cruel and malicious fighters in the Multiverse. Barda's abilities and take-charge attitude even allowed her to become the leader of the Female Furies, a ferocious and powerful group of warriors who served as the personal guard to Apokolips's tyrannical ruler, Darkseid. Barda served Darkseid for many years—until she met Mister Miracle. The two fell in love and Barda began questioning Darkseid’s cruelty and totalitarian philosophy. Eventually, she fled to Earth, battling her way through the hordes of Apokolips and her former allies—defeating them all.  Barda continues to share a close and romantic relationship with Mister Miracle, despite their contrasting personalities. Whereas Mister Miracle is more peaceful and kind, Barda loves to fight and relishes battle. She's the brawn to his brain, and as the more powerful of the two, tends to be very protective of him.  As a New God, Barda possesses immense levels of enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina and more. Barda is also a master of multiple forms of combat and an expert swordswoman, capable of fighting even Wonder Woman to a stand-still. Her height alone makes her one of the tallest and most intimidating heroes in the universe. Along with her physical capabilities, Barda wears Apokoliptian armor that enhances her impressive abilities and wields the Mega-Rod, which may look small but packs a punch that could level mountains. As a high-tech weapon, the Mega-Rod fires powerful concussive bolts, increases gravitational forces and allows Barda to instantaneously teleport herself and others great distances.",

Few villains in the DC Universe are Superman's equal in power, but there is one who can always go toe to toe with the Man of Steel in a fight—his twisted doppelganger, Bizarro. The tragic result of a bizarre science experiment gone horribly wrong, Bizarro is an imperfect duplicate of Kal-El, with none of his intelligence or self-control. Looking like a pasty white, zombie-like version of the Last Son of Krypton, he invariably strikes fear into those he encounters. Often a creature more to be pitied than feared, Bizarro nevertheless is as dangerous as it gets...whether he means to be lethal or not.  There have been many versions of Bizarro over the years, some created by science and some by magical means, but he has been a persistent thorn in the side of Superman since the earliest days of the Silver Age. Usually wanting nothing more than to be seen as the hero that his famous counterpart Superman is, he has often developed a strong hatred for his \"perfect\" brother. Sometimes misguided, sometimes genuinely malevolent, and even sometimes a true hero himself, Bizarro is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with.",

Over the course of a century, three different men from very different backgrounds have taken on the heroic mantle of the Blue Beetle, each making their mark in different ways. The original Beetle was an archaeologist named Dan Garrett, who discovered an ancient Scarab in an old Egyptian tomb that gave him superpowers which he used to fight crime. He was succeeded by the brilliant Ted Kord, who had no powers to speak of, but carried on the Blue Beetle legacy with just his wits and his fists, along with a whole lot of gadgets and a sharp sense of humor.  The most recent Blue Beetle is Jaime Reyes, a teenager from El Paso, Texas who bonded with Dan Garrett's Scarab. The artifact gave him incredible alien armor which he used to defend his hometown from all manner of metahuman criminals. A Blue Beetle has been a part of the superhero community in the DC Universe in some form since 1939, serving both as a solo adventurer and as a part of teams like the Justice League and the Teen Titans, creating one of the greatest heroic legacies in the DCU.",

When opportunity arises, you have to seize it! That’s an idea that has driven Mike Carter, a college football star of the 25th Century who earned the nickname “Booster” on the field. Even though people assured him a professional career of fame and fortune was in his future, he decided he couldn’t wait and wagered on his own games. The scandal halted his dreams of professional stardom and ruined his reputation. Taking a job as a security guard in the Metropolis Space Museum, Mike saw another opportunity after studying the early age of superheroes. With future and alien technology stolen from the museum, and a time machine that was on display, he realized he could not only become a superhero himself in a past era where his criminal history was unknown, but he could also make his good deeds profitable.  With his robot pal Skeets at his side, Mike time-traveled to the modern age and debuted as Booster Gold. For years now, he’s fought evil alongside different versions of the Justice League and his good pal Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle. Recently, Booster Gold has broadened his scope and acts as a protector of history itself. Though always eager to take credit for good deeds on social media or sign with a well-paying sponsor, Booster is a good guy at heart and will drop everything if he genuinely sees someone in need.",

Nevertheless, Brainiac shares Luthor’s intense hatred of the Man of Steel, and has continued to use his Twelfth-Level intellect over the years to bring down the Last Son of Krypton.  Originally from the planet most frequently named Colu, Brainiac’s artificial mind and body have morphed several times over the decades, but his unquenchable thirst for absolute knowledge, regardless of the billions of innocent lives which might be destroyed in the process, has made him one of the deadliest villains the universe has ever seen. For Brainiac, the knowledge he acquires is only valuable if he and he alone possesses it, and no one else.  Thanks to his highly advanced, computerized brain, Brainiac is always ten steps ahead of his opponents, even ones as clever as Superman. Ultimately, his inability to see beyond pure logic has always been his downfall. But like a bad computer virus that can never be fully purged, Brainiac always manages to turn up again when one least expects him.",

He patterned his life around obsessively observing holidays and dates, something that eventually caused his mind to fracture. He turned to a life of crime, maintaining his penchant for calendar-themed events, which made him an easy mark for the Batman. Yet over the years, in and out of Arkham Asylum, Julian would become a resource for Batman in his detective work. He helped the Dark Knight bring in the infamous Holiday killer, a case in which Julian himself was originally the prime suspect.  More recently, Julian’s powers and obsessions have evolved, and he now has metahuman abilities that cause his body to literally fall in step with the changing of the seasons.

The Bat may be the king of the beasts of Gotham. But the Cat? The Cat is definitely the queen. Infamous burglar Selina Kyle is certainly one of the most iconic characters in the DC Universe—not because she's a superhero, per se, but because she's so good at stumping them. Motivated partly by her own self interest, partly by the fun of it all, Catwoman has been baffling Gotham City's heroes, both masked and unmasked, from the very beginning.  An accomplished jewel thief and an occasional hero herself, Selina's murky moral compass has made her relationship with Batman complicated, to say the least. Still, the undeniable magnetism between Bat and Cat is one of Gotham's most reliable constants: wherever Catwoman goes, Batman is sure to follow, if only to take her down. It's a complicated game of cat-and-mouse (cat-and-bat?) that Bruce and Selina have been playing across the streets and rooftops of Gotham for a long, long time.",

Bold, brave and decidedly deadly, Jade Nguyen had a tragic and violent childhood. Born to a Vietnamese woman raped by U.S. Senator Robert Pullman, she was sold into slavery and killed her master, setting her down a lethal path that continues to this day. As a teenager, Jade refined her assassination techniques, studying under all manner of killers and masters of the lethal arts. Her teachers included the revolutionary Weng Chan and the assassin Kruen Musenda, a.k.a. Spitting Cobra, to whom Jade was married for two years until his death.  By her late teens, Jade had become known as Cheshire, a famed martial artist and assassin who specializes in the use of poison. With a reputation for being efficient and tight-lipped, Cheshire has accepted contracts from a variety of organizations, including the League of Assassins and the Secret Society of Super-Villains. In the process, she’s frequently fought against Earth’s heroes.  There is, however, one major exception. Earlier in her life, Cheshire fell in love with the former Teen Titan named Roy Harper when he was working undercover. Their relationship produced a daughter, Lian, who was believed to have been killed during an attack on Roy’s hometown of Star City. It turns out that’s not the case—Lian is alive and living on the streets of Gotham. However, far from giving Cheshire something to live for, motherhood seems to have made Jade that much colder. With Roy and her daughter out of her life, any connection she had to her humanity is now gone and forgotten. The possibility of a more meaningful life is just another victim in her wake. ",

One of the planet’s greatest heroes, Cyborg nevertheless puts all of his internal struggles aside when the time comes to save innocent lives and protect the Earth.

Although Deadman would eventually catch his murderer, who'd killed him as part of an elaborate initiation ritual to join an elite group of assassins, he continued to use his abilities to help people in the mortal world. While the majority of Earth's heroes don't know about Brand's existence as Deadman, there are a select few who do. He's worked several times with Batman, as well as more supernaturally inclined heroes like the Spectre and the Sentinels of Magic. In more recent years, he's served as a member of the Justice League Dark. Whether solo or partnered with other heroes, Deadman continues to haunt the Earth, protecting the innocent and working to balance the scales of justice.",

Boasting that he never misses a shot, Lawton became infamous as a deadly marksman and gun-for-hire, a reputation that earned him no shortage of trouble with both the law and the superhero community.  During one of his prison stays, Lawton was recruited by Amanda Waller to join the covert Task Force X, otherwise known as the Suicide Squad, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. A thrill-seeker with a self-destructive personality, Lawton readily accepted the terms and went on to become one of the Squad’s longest-serving members.  Though he’s violent, dangerously unbalanced and murderous, Lawton has, over time, shown a capacity for good.

Dr. Cylvia Cyber—the original Dr. Cyber—was the twisted mastermind behind a global criminal network. She became Wonder Woman's archnemesis at a time when the Amazon was stripped of her powers and known only as Agent Diana Prince. During an early encounter with Diana, Cyber was disfigured when a rival criminal group threw hot coals on her face. Blaming Wonder Woman for the disfigurement, Cyber sought revenge. She began wearing a cybernetic gold mask to hide her scars and a high-tech cybernetic suit that enhanced her physical strength and allowed her to fire energy blasts. This original incarnation of Dr. Cyber died before the events of 1985’s Crisis on Infinite Earths.  Recently, an even more powerful version of the villain has arisen. This new Dr. Cyber is Dr. Adrianna Anderson, a renowned scientist and a close friend of Empire Industries CEO Veronica Cale. Adrianna was convinced by Cale, an avowed enemy of Wonder Woman, to use an experimental \"cyber walker suit\" to fight the Amazon. The suit, however, was damaged, and Adrianna's mind was trapped within its systems as she died. Her mind was later transferred to an A.I. system, where she became a digital construct going by the name Dr. Cyber. This new version of Cyber aided Cale in her plans against Wonder Woman.",

The experience awakened in Cizko latent powers of illusion and hypnosis. He used his abilities to bend people (particularly women, whom he resented) to his will, and often fought the Amazon Princess.  Following the history-altering events of 1985’s Crisis on Infinite Earths, Edgar Cizko was reintroduced as a psychologist obsessed with telepathy, leading some to mockingly call him “Dr. Psycho.” But thanks to his research, he gained a multitude of psionic powers. He possessed powers not only of telepathy, but mind control, telekinesis, astral projection and psi energy (or ectokinesis) that he could use to create and animate constructs. Unfortunately, Cizko was a sadist who hated women and enjoyed terrifying and torturing people to further his research into the human mind…and sometimes simply for enjoyment. More than once, he’s helped other villains attack or manipulate Earth’s heroes. Upon occasion, he has joined the Secret Society of Super-Villains (a.k.a. the Society).",

Wonder Woman has long served as the living embodiment of truth, so it only makes sense that one of her most dangerous adversaries since the early days of World War II has been the living representation of deceit and lies—the Duke of Deception. An immortal demigod within the Greek pantheon who has existed for thousands of years, the Duke is a minion of Ares, the god of war and Wonder Woman's greatest foe. In service to his master, the Duke, acting from his base on the planet Mars, has helped spread falsehoods in an effort to cause conflict in humanity—conflict that would ultimately result in the wars Ares so desperately craved.  The Duke often sends his astral form to world leaders and “whispers” lies and duplicitous thoughts into their minds, all in an effort to stoke the fires of war. The Duke can also create illusions, often changing his physical appearance so as to appear as anyone he desires. He can also delude the minds of ordinary humans, ultimately driving them insane. While the Duke went unseen for many years and presumed dead, a deity using Roman-style armor has recently emerged using his name and teaming up with several of Wonder Woman's super-villains under the leadership of the sorceress Circe. Has the destructive Duke truly returned? Or is this, like so many of Diana’s encounters with him in the past, merely another deception?",

Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the Teen Titans may be household names to us, but rest assured, these are not the seasoned veterans with storied histories we’ve come to know and love.  On the newly formed Earth-1, these heroes are just starting out. They’re untested, raw and prone to rookie mistakes. They’re learning on the job. Sounds rough, right? Not entirely. They also have a tremendous drive to protect those who can’t protect themselves. As a result, they have the courage to emerge as the first heroes of this infant Earth.    Will they succeed?

These small-minded tyrants have used propaganda, intimidation, fear, torture and war as a means to reign over those they consider inferior. Their aggression—appalling. Their motives—disturbing. The atrocities—heartbreaking.    With that in mind, what if Hitler’s Nazi war machine seized control of the free world? One need not look further than Earth-10 to get the answer.  When the rocket carrying a young Kal-L crashed in Czechoslovakia, Nazi scientists quickly reverse-engineered its technology to secure a WWII victory. As the years passed, the troubled Kal-L—now known as Overman—grew up to lead a team made up of heroes of the Reich, including Leatherwing, Brunhilde, Blitzen and Underwaterman on a mission to uphold the Nazi ideals. Better known as the “New Reichsmen,” these super-powered beings don’t hesitate to execute Blitzkrieg in the name of the Fuhrer.  Thankfully, history has a flipside, and contains stories of men and women willing to push back against the oppressors. Earth-10 is no different. Lead by Uncle Sam, a “terrorist” group known as the “Freedom Fighters” opposes the New Reichsmen. Its members: The Ray, Black Condor, the Human Bomb, Doll Man and Doll Woman represent the heart and soul of the people the Nazis tried to exterminate.  Fueled by the injustices of both the past and present, the Freedom Fighters’ mission is one of the most commendable. They’re truly the light in one of the Multiverse’s darkest Earths.   ",

Together this team, like the Justice League that preceded it, battles the evil that threatens this world.  Earth-12 serves as a reminder that the future is often a sad reminder that problems and shortcomings may never be solved, and in fact sometimes worsen. However, it can also be a source of comfort and hope—an advanced world where heroes like Terry and the Justice League Beyond continue our quest for truth, justice and a better tomorrow.

Imagine, then, what might happen if they were all to fall in the same battle.  Many people would lose hope and drift into despair. But Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Kendra Munoz-Saunders, Thomas Wayne, Val-Zod and many other men and women of Earth-2 saw it as a calling, rising up to form a new generation of heroes determined to pick up where the previous ones left off.

Not always trusted by the people of their world, these new heroes will be tested from all sides, never more so than by the beings that destroyed their predecessors in the first place—the evil New Gods of Apokolips. With the fate of Earth-2 on the line, these diverse individuals must put aside their differences and stand together, succeeding where others before them have failed, freeing their world of the threats seeking its destruction.

For Earth-3, that day finally arrived as the entire world was eliminated by an even larger instrument of devastation—the Anti-Monitor.

On the surface the city seems like any other, but take a closer look and you'll see it's a rich and lustrous environment that shines in no small part to the many super heroes who reside there. These remarkable men and women live and work within this urban metropolis, and when necessary, save the day from the many villains who also call its streets their home.  One group in particular stands out among Cosmoville's super citizens: The Light Brigade. The team is led by Savior—the valiant last survivor of the ancient super-civilization of Mu. Savior was sent into the future in order to escape certain doom, forming the Light Brigade to keep his newly adopted home safe. Of course, the fact that he was practically surrounded by super heroes didn’t hurt and filling the team's ranks with a variety of skill sets and abilities proved much simpler than on other worlds. Herculina, Radman, Goodfellow, Formula-1, Ghostman, Master Motley, Cutie, the Stingray and many others stand tall and make Cosmoville proud and thrill its non-powered citizens with their exploits.",

That vengeance becomes their very existence, consuming them and motivating their every move. People like this have likely suffered unimaginable loss and they feel responsible. Or they may be suffering from the curse of El Diablo…  When gang leader Chato Santana was left severely wounded after being betrayed by his second-in-command, he found himself sharing a hospital room with the comatose gunslinger Lazarus Lane. The nearly dead Santana traveled to the spirit world, where Lane passed the El Diablo curse he had been suffering from on to him. It wasn’t a gift. The El Diablo curse is rooted in revenge and punishment. It drives the afflicted to seek right for any wrongs that have been done, regardless of the cost. It bestows its host with a variety of abilities, most notably pyrokinesis and extreme resistance to injury, as well as supernatural skills such as seeing a person’s sins written on their soul and communicating with spirits in the great beyond.  Chato used his newfound pyrokinesis when going after a rival gang. He set the gang’s home ablaze and accidentally killed an innocent woman and children in the process. Remorseful over his crime, Chato didn’t resist arrest and found himself calling Belle Reve Penitentiary home. Proving his loyalty under extreme duress, he was soon inducted into the Suicide Squad. Though his repentant attitude often runs counter to the devil-may-care approach of his teammates, Chato’s abilities as El Diablo have helped the Squad’s success rate tremendously.",

Though she’s changed a lot over the years, Etta always stands as a representation for the power of sisterhood.  As Jimmy Olsen is to Superman, the bold and brassy Etta Candy is Wonder Woman’s best pal. A boisterous young woman with a lust for life and an appetite for sweets rivaled only by her one for boys, in the Golden Age, Etta Candy was the sheltered Wonder Woman’s guide to many of the Earthly pleasures which man’s world had to offer—and, as head of the always lively Beeta Lambda sorority at Holliday College, Diana’s window into the nature of sisterhood outside of Paradise Island as well. Before long, Etta Candy was fast friends with not only Diana, but her alter ego Wonder Woman, as well. Whenever the Amazon Princess needed a hand, Etta Candy and her “Holliday Girls” were always on the way to help with a “WOO! WOO!” battle cry—all thanks to a special radio of Diana’s design which allowed her to send mental telegrams directly to the Beeta Lambda sorority house.  After Crisis on Infinite Earths, Wonder Woman’s history was largely rewritten. Etta Candy herself was reinvented as Colonel Steve Trevor’s personal aide, love interest, and eventually his wife.  Following Flashpoint, Etta Candy was reinvented once again. Her marriage to Steve Trevor was undone, and she served as a field commander at the metahuman defense agency known as A.R.G.U.S. Etta was once more one of the first friends Diana had made in the modern world. But this time, Commander Candy’s feelings leaned towards another mutual friend of Wonder Woman’s: the brainy, adventurous archaeologist Barbara Ann Minerva. But while Barbara reciprocated Etta’s feelings, their relationship was doomed by Dr. Minerva’s transformation into Wonder Woman’s arch-enemy, the Cheetah.

One of her fellow revelers was missing, one was in a mental ward—and one knew that Eve was responsible.  Now, Eve works as a cop in Boston. But when she’s shot in the head and undergoes neural surgery, Eve must leave her job behind and return to Coffin Hill. There she’ll discover that the darkness she unleashed ten years ago in the woods was never contained. It continues to seep through the town, cursing the very soul of the once sleepy Massachusetts hollow, spilling secrets and enacting its revenge. Set against the haunted backdrop of New England, Coffin Hill is a work of horror that explores what people will do for power and retribution and lays bare the danger and futility of running away from the past.",

No, it appears the laws of physics are no different than all other laws. They’re not immune to getting broken.  In response to the growing number of scientific disasters, the United States government created the FBP—The Federal Bureau of Physics. Staffed by men and women of science and action alike, the agents of the FBP are the first line of defense against a world gone wacky. Adam Hardy is one such agent. Young, talented and smart, he’s more than capable, but less than driven. At least until he’s faced with a conspiracy involving his father’s death. Now, Adam must rise to the challenge, unravel this great mystery of science and figure out just what’s wrong with the FBP—and the world.",

They say two heads are better than one, and that old adage was never more true than in the case of Firestorm, one of Earth's most powerful superheroes, as he is literally two beings fused into one body. When teenager Ronnie Raymond was caught in a nuclear accident with the brilliant Professor Martin Stein, their atoms fused together, creating a powerful metahuman who could emit deadly nuclear fire and alter inorganic matter into whatever form he could imagine. The brash teenager Ronnie had control of Firestorm's conscious mind and body, while Stein existed in the background, guiding his actions.  Becoming the youngest member ever admitted into the ranks of the Justice League at the time, the flame-haired Nuclear Man served alongside the likes of Superman and Batman for many years, earning the respect of the old guard of heroes, while forging his own path for a new generation of heroic icons. Although he'd undergo many different permutations as time went on, adding the Russian hero Pozhar to the Firestorm matrix, and later, teenager Jason Rusch, Firestorm always remained one of the Earth's most staunch defenders, not to mention one of the most powerful beings on the planet.

There are not a lot of villains in Wonder Woman's rogues gallery who are a match for the Amazing Amazon in a physical fight, but the woman called Giganta is one of them. In the Golden Age, Giganta was actually an artificially mutated ape, whom a scientist named Professor Zool transformed into a red-haired strongwoman of huge proportions. In the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths universe, Giganta was Dr. Doris Zeul, a scientist who was dying from a rare blood disease. She captured Wonder Woman and planned to put her own \"life-essence\" into Diana's body, but the process was interrupted by Wonder Girl and her consciousness instead ends up in a test animal gorilla named Giganta.  While still inside of the gorilla's body, Dr. Zeul abducted a comatose circus strongwoman named Olga with metahuman size-changing abilities and successfully transferred her consciousness into Olga's body, leaving Olga's own mind stranded inside the gorilla. Keeping the name Giganta, she embarked on a career as a super-villain, fighting with Wonder Woman several times, both alone and with a variety of different villain teams. But Giganta has a tender side as well, and briefly enjoyed a romance with the Atom, Ryan Choi. Post-Flashpoint, Doris Zeul became a child who was often bullied and afflicted with a rare blood condition. She was cured by a scientific procedure which also gave her size-changing powers, a side effect of which was a far more limited intellect.

The product of a chance encounter with an alien race, Grodd and his people evolved past the common gorillas who lived in his portion of the African jungle and developed super intelligence, along with a wide array of other mental powers. But while the rest of his people chose to live apart from the world peacefully, Grodd only sought to conquer humanity so he could rule it.  First coming into conflict with the Barry Allen version of the Flash, Grodd was a thorn in not only his side for many years, but also his successor Wally West's. Grodd also plagued the Justice League by joining forces with the likes of the Secret Society of Super-Villains, the Legion of Doom and other organizations of super criminals bent on world domination. With his genius-level intellect combined with his innate animal savagery and his vast mental abilities, Gorilla Grodd is, ironically, not an enemy to ever be monkeyed with.   ",

Originally from the peasant class of the planet Apokolips called the \"Lowlies,\" the woman who would become known for anything other than Goodness was taken from her parents at a young age and trained to become one of Darkseid's loyal Hounds. After proving herself to be one of Darkseid's most effective soldiers, she was tasked with running his training camp for his new minions. Named \"the Orphanage,\" within its boundaries she tortured and brainwashed her trainees into becoming fanatical soldiers who were willing to die for the glory of Darkseid.  After many years, once she became a haggard old woman (a stark contrast to most New Gods who didn’t age), she earned the nickname Granny Goodness. Aside from Darkseid's common soldiers, she also trained a highly elite and deadly group of women warriors called the Female Furies as well as Highfather's son, Scott Free, though he would escape and become the superhero named Mister Miracle. When the centuries-long war between the planets Apokolips and New Genesis found itself being played out on Earth, Granny Goodness was sent to run orphanages there, looking for potential warriors for Darkseid.

Although he is commonly thought of by many as just a modern-day Robin Hood, the Green Arrow is so much more than that limited description would lead you to believe. Born to a life of wealth and privilege, Oliver Queen took it all for granted until tragedy struck at sea, leaving him alone on a deserted island. There, Queen had to dig deep to find out if he had the inner fortitude to survive. While stranded on this island, Oliver honed his already formidable archery skills into becoming the greatest archer ever known.  When he finally returned to civilization, he embarked on a career as an urban vigilante, attempting to rid the streets of his hometown of Seattle, and also Star City, from crime and corruption with nothing but a bow and arrow. Viewed as a pampered playboy by the outside world, Green Arrow cares more about the plight of the poor and the suffering in America perhaps more than any other costumed superhero—a “social justice warrior” in the truest sense of the word.  Although an imperfect man, prone to make mistakes in his personal life probably more than most other costumed crusaders, the Green Arrow is nevertheless one of the greatest heroes in the entire DC Universe.

Although there have been several incarnations of H.I.V.E. throughout the years, each founded by various members of the super-villain community—including Damien Darhk, Queen Bee and Adeline Kane—its main mission statement has remained the same. Sometimes the organization pushes its own agenda; other times, it offers its services to anyone willing to pay the right price.  H.I.V.E. consists of many skilled members, from scientists to trained assassins. Although willing to go after any super heroes, H.I.V.E. often finds itself at odds with the Teen Titans, and as such, has regularly worked alongside the team's greatest adversary, Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke.",

Young orphan Lyla Michaels was marked for death at sea in a violent shipwreck, and as far as the world was concerned, that was her fate. In truth, Lyla was saved moments before her demise by a powerful being known as the Monitor. Locked in eternal struggle for the fate of reality with his antimatter counterpart, the Anti-Monitor, the Monitor had chosen Lyla to act as his personal agent in observing, testing and preparing the world’s greatest heroes and villains for the day their battle spilled over into their universe. To accomplish this important task, the Monitor granted Lyla the powers of strength, flight, regeneration and, most importantly, duplication, allowing her to occupy multiple points at once in order to better prepare the earth for combat in the limited time before the Crisis on Infinite Earths and announce the event’s coming. In this capacity, Lyla Michaels assumed the identity of the Harbinger for her grave but essential duty to announce the doom of the world should its defenders fail to defeat the Anti-Monitor.  But unwittingly, Harbinger proved just as effective as an agent of the Anti-Monitor himself. When the Crisis arrived, the Anti-Monitor managed to corrupt Harbinger, leading her to betray the Monitor and bring about his death by her own hands. Mad with grief over what she had done, Harbinger shook free of the Anti-Monitor’s influence and used the last of her powers to save the doomed worlds of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X, allowing its heroes to merge into the New Earth which arose at the end of the Crisis.

Sometimes love can make people do crazy things. Other times? It drives them completely insane. Such is the case with Harley Quinn, formerly Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A promising psychologist and intern at Arkham Asylum in Gotham City, Harleen was given the chance to get up close and personal with the Joker, an experience that wound up ending…badly. Harleen became obsessed with her subject, and after falling madly in love with the Clown Prince of Crime, she helped him escape the asylum.  Her love for the Joker inspired Harleen to adopt a new identity, that of Harley Quinn, the Joker’s sidekick-slash-love interest—whether he wanted one or not. (Most of the time? He did not.)  In time, Harley came to realize the Joker was holding her back and she struck out on her own. She became an entrepreneur and a member of several slightly less-than-reputable super teams (including the Suicide Squad), Gotham City’s all-girl gang the Gotham City Sirens, and a traveling sideshow. Along the way Harley has become one of the most popular super-villains in the DC Universe, thanks in part to her versatility, charisma and cheery-but-deranged outlook on life.  After all, as Harley would say, if you're going to go a little crazy, you may as well sit back and enjoy the ride!",

It’s just that in a city like Gotham, to uphold the law, you sometimes have to be willing to break it.  At least, that’s how Detective Harvey Bullock sees it. A good cop worn down by the corruption of Gotham, Bullock may appear slovenly or even oafish, but don’t be fooled. He’s a smart man, dedicated to solving crimes. He just knows that in this city, sometimes to solve a crime you need to cross the line. Whether it’s taking a bribe, roughing up a perp or forging ties with organized crime, Bullock is more than willing to bend the rules to keep the people of Gotham safe and put the truly dangerous criminals behind bars.  Even though he may operate in a decidedly gray area, Bullock has righteous intentions. He's loyal to the job and Commissioner Gordon, and has a begrudging respect for Batman. Bullock's willingness to push the boundaries of ethics in favor of getting results to benefit the greater good has proven effective, but it's dangerous territory. He must exercise caution to ensure he doesn't go too far and lose his way. Otherwise, this cop, who has devoted his life to upholding the law, may just find himself on the wrong side of it.",

The cosmic forces that maintain balance in the universe work in strange and unexpected ways. Years ago, the Lords of Chaos and Order gifted brothers Hank and Don Hall with superpowers, transforming them into the superhero team Hawk and Dove, the avatars for the forces of War and Peace.  Hank became Hawk, a red-and-white-clad superhero defined by anger and aggression, while Don, known for his compassion and levelheadedness, became Dove, who wore a mirroring blue-and-white costume. Hank’s shoot-first, ask-questions-later attitude, coupled with his unwillingness to compromise and mile-wide stubborn streak, made him a difficult person to work with for just about everyone but his brother—and even Don had his limits—while Don’s eagerness to see compromise and aversion to fighting often made him reluctant to act.  Tragically, the brothers’ partnership was cut short when Don was killed during the catastrophic events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths. College student Dawn Granger was chosen by the Lords to replace him. Over time, Hank accepted Dawn as a fitting successor to his brother.  Dawn’s level head, along with her willingness to see reason and compromise, make her the perfect counterpoint to Hank’s hair-trigger rage and stubbornness. But her measured manner should never be mistaken for weakness. Even though she may be more careful with her power than her partner is, she’s anything but a pushover.

A queen since the day she was created by the Gods of Olympus some 3,000 years ago, Hippolyta is actually the reincarnated soul of a cavewoman who was killed by her mate in prehistoric times. She, along with several women, who were also reincarnated souls whose lives were cut short by man's hatred, formed the noble Amazon tribe in ancient times. The jealous war god Ares influenced the demigod Heracles into seducing Hippolyta, and then enslaving her after he'd gained her trust. Freed by the goddess Athena, Hippolyta liberated her Amazon sisters and defeated Heracles' soldiers. As atonement for being deceived, she and her sisters were exiled to the island of Themyscira, where they would remain isolated from mankind and immortal as long as they remained there.  Eventually, Hippolyta was gifted with a daughter, whom she named Diana. Blessed with powers from the gods themselves, it is unclear if Diana was created when Hippolyta crafted a child made of clay which was gifted with life, or if Diana was born from an affair between herself and Zeus, as there are conflicting accounts to Diana’s creation. Reluctantly, Queen Hippolyta allowed her daughter Diana to leave Themyscira and become Wonder Woman, a fact which has caused her constant worry. While once Hippolyta took her daughter's place as Wonder Woman and travelled back in time to have adventures with the Justice Society, today, Queen Hippolyta remains on Themyscira, ruling over its people and separated from her daughter Diana, who can never return.

Born into a chaotic web of warring mob families in Gotham City, Helena Bertinelli's life has always been a mess of violent extremes. At eight years old, she witnessed the murder of her mother, father and brother, an event that left her in the care of her uncle in Sicily. He taught her the code she would come to live by: \"Blood cries for blood.\" In order for Helena to proceed with her life, she would have to exact revenge on the people responsible for her family's murder.  After spending her early teenage years training, she returned to Gotham City, only to learn the true depth of the Mafia's corruption. After witnessing the Batman in action, Helena vowed to follow his example and purge the city of corruption by any means necessary—even if it meant crossing lines Batman would not.  Caught in a struggle between her rage and her role as a DC superhero, Huntress has come to represent the darker shades of gray in Gotham.

The superhero known worldwide as Icon is actually an alien being who hailed from the planet Terminus. In 1839, an extraterrestrial starship travelling near Earth malfunctioned and exploded, but not before one of its passengers found his way onto a life pod, which then crashed in the middle of a cotton field in the American South. As a failsafe, the pod automatically altered the appearance of its inhabitant, named Arnus, to mimic the first sentient life-form he had contact with, who happened to be a slave woman named Miriam. She adopted the young Arnus as her son and he changed his name to Augustus Freeman.  Although Arnus had powers nearly identical to those of Superman, he chose to hide his abilities and live as a normal man, only occasionally using his powers in secret to help others. Barely aging over a century, \"Augustus Freeman\" would change his identity every few decades, posing as his own son. Now known as Augustus Freeman IV, a \"by-the-book\" lawyer in Dakota City, he used his powers for the first time in decades on a gang of home intruders—an event that was witnessed by a young, idealistic girl named Raquel Ervin. After seeing Augustus in action, she convinced him to become a superhero so he could serve as an \"Icon\" to millions who need inspiration. Raquel eventually became his sidekick, calling herself Rocket. While Icon has been a member of teams like the Shadow Cabinet and even the Justice League, these days he’s back to basics, fighting alongside Rocket for the good of Dakota and the world.",

Donning a costume and stylized metal helmet based on the one worn by the Roman god Mercury, Jay used his powers to fight crime and protect the citizens of Keystone City. He became the Fastest Man Alive, the Hero of Earth-2, the Flash!  A founding member of the Justice Society of America—whose ranks include Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Wildcat, Power Girl and more—Jay was one of the first super heroes of Earth-2, a parallel world to the main DC Universe and home to the heroes of the Golden Age. As the Flash, Jay battled many super-criminals and saved the world alongside his friends numerous times. But he forever changed not only his world, but all worlds when he met his Earth-1 counterpart, Barry Allen. This famous meeting of the Flash of Two Worlds bridged the gap between realities and led to many team-ups, alignments and friendships between the heroes of both Earths. Together, the Flashes would join forces to battle Zoom, the Reverse-Flash, and many other super-villains.  By tapping into the extra-dimensional Speed Force, Jay can move at speeds approaching the speed of light. This power also allows him to have faster than normal reflexes and grants him the ability to vibrate fast enough to obscure his features, preventing the need for him to wear a mask. His experience, compassion and kindness have led him to become a mentor to not only future generations of speedsters, but to countless other heroes throughout the DC Universe.",

But she holds the distinction of being Sector 2814’s first official female representative in the Corps.  The result of a tragic event in her youth, Jessica suffers from crippling anxiety, and, before becoming an official Lantern, was chosen to wear another kind of weapon—the evil Ring of Volthoom. Unlike a Green Lantern Ring, the Ring of Volthoom chose Jessica for succumbing to fear, not overcoming it. Although the ancient ring was at first a corrupting influence and exerted its control over Jessica, she was eventually able to break free and use its powers for good. After an act of self-sacrifice, Jessica was given a Green Lantern Ring and chosen to become a member of the Corps.  Alongside her frequent partner, Simon Baz, Jessica is now one of two Green Lanterns assigned to the planet Earth and the other planets in its sector of space. Although she still has a lot to learn and many personal obstacles to overcome, she’s proven herself as one of the Earth’s most heroic protectors.

Despite his outwardly youthful appearance, often shown wearing a bow tie and sporting freckles, James Olsen is a career journalist and photographer at the Daily Planet, and has been since his late teens, when he was an intern for Perry White. In most versions of his history, Olsen was present when Superman made his public debut and has been friends with both the Man of Steel and his alter ego Clark Kent ever since.  Despite just being an ordinary guy, Jimmy Olsen is braver than most, and is always willing to put himself in real danger in order to get that elusive photo or get the scoop that’ll land him the story of the century. Almost always forthright and true, James Olsen always has his BFF Superman’s back, even if it’s Superman who winds up needing to watch Jimmy’s back most of the time.

If you're dealing with trouble that skews a bit supernatural, you'd better get yourself to the expert. John Constantine isn't known for his glowing personality, but when it comes to the occult, he's the best investigator there is. Like anything in life, however, Constantine's skill set comes with a price.   A notorious con man and grifter whose past has a body count, Constantine's moral compass is as gray as can be. He's an expert sorcerer and magician, but also an accomplished liar and thief known for his vices, self-loathing and on-again-off-again death wish. His abilities have afforded him the opportunity not only to cheat death, but to trick the forces that govern Heaven and Hell...meaning he has no shortage of powerful enemies.   Still, although John's motives may be suspect more often than not, with enough effort, his selfishness can be chipped away, revealing a decent person buried beneath a carefully crafted persona. A lifetime of pain and suffering has hardened the Hellblazer on the outside, but deep down, he wants to do the right thing.",

Earth has produced many fine members of the Green Lantern Corps, but among its finest stands U.S. Marine Corps veteran John Stewart. Although he was originally chosen by the Guardians of the Universe as the “alternate” Lantern, called in to wear the power ring whenever Hal Jordan was incapacitated, Stewart has grown to become a leader of the Green Lantern Corps.  A former architect, Stewart creates his power ring constructs differently than his fellow Lanterns, as they are never hollow. He always builds them from the inside out, down to the last nut and bolt—the result of his keen architectural mind. Stewart also differs from some of Earth’s other Green Lanterns in that he has chosen not to conceal his identity behind a mask.  John Stewart has suffered numerous tragedies in his life.

Most are generally human. But one stands apart—the massive freak of nature known as Killer Croc. Born as Waylon Jones, Croc has a rare genetic condition which gives him a crocodilian appearance. Raised by an abusive aunt who mocked his deformity, he eventually ran away and joined the circus, becoming a sideshow carnival attraction, where patrons could come and gawk at the freakish strongman called \"Killer Croc.\" Croc eventually departed for Gotham City, where he began a life of crime—one which brought him into regular conflict with the Dark Knight.  Although he began as just a man with crocodile-like skin, over the years, Killer Croc's appearance has grown more and more inhuman. Croc now has a more bestial form, complete with a truly reptilian head, razor sharp claws and teeth, and a tail. His animal nature has made him a formidable foe, but his limited intellect has kept him from ever truly achieving his true potential. Nevertheless, Croc’s brute strength and killer instincts have made him an ever-present thorn in Batman’s side, who must be ever vigilant in case the deadly Croc once again emerges from the sewers below to wreak havoc on Gotham City.

He may not always be the most disciplined of sidekicks, but Krypto has long served as the Superman Family’s loyal companion and defender, while coming to the aid of anyone in need of a helping paw or two.  Krypto’s Kryptonian biology gives him Superman’s own abilities, including flight, super-strength, super-speed and super-breath, all of which make him the ideal four-legged friend for the cape-and-cowl-wearing community. Krypto currently spends his days as the Kent family’s pooch, a little less concerned with day-to-day heroics and a little more with playing a good round of fetch with Supergirl or Clark and Lois’ son, Jon, a.k.a.

A notorious sociopath and xenophobe in almost every one of his incarnations—be it scientist, businessman or even the President of the United States—Luthor always uses his power and influence not to help mankind, but to attempt to destroy the one man on the planet who makes him feel insignificant: Superman.  Although he has no superpowers to speak of, Luthor has come closer to defeating the Man of Steel more times than any of his other adversaries. With his brilliant mind, Luthor’s schemes nearly always come close to vanquishing Superman, until his massive ego gets in his way. No matter the situation, it’s Luthor’s hubris that’s always his downfall.  To much of the world, Lex Luthor is a respectable, self-made man—the pinnacle of human achievement, due to his massive wealth and standing in the worlds of business and politics.

Just like Black Lightning, she had trouble controlling them at first. And much like her older sister Anissa, Jennifer was forbidden from beginning her career as a superhero until she completed her education. But when her father saw how she was struggling to control her powers, which manifested around her body as a glowing electrical aura with lightning-like energy spikes on her head and back, he asked the Justice Society of America to take her in and help her master her abilities. Soon, with a better handle on controlling her seriously powerful abilities, Jennifer took on the identity of Lightning.  As a member of the JSA, Lightning instantly formed a friendship with her teammates and fellow teenagers Stargirl and Cyclone, and also began a romantic relationship with another teammate, Jakeem Thunder. Jennifer has a bit of an ongoing rivalry with her sister Anissa, who despite being older, entered the superhero game after her as Thunder. Forbidden from pursing her heroic career until she was an adult, Anissa resents her younger sister for being allowed to become a teenage superhero. She also believes that Jennifer was always viewed as \"the favorite\" among her parents. Yet, despite the occasionally heated rivalry, the two sisters always have each other’s back, as well as that of their father, proving that even in the high-stakes realm of superheroism, family always comes first.",

He’s the best bounty hunter in the known universe and the last sentient being you’d ever want to get into a bar fight with if you hope to make it out in one piece. He’s the intergalactic alien badass known as Lobo, often called by his nickname “The Main Man,” and if you’re lucky, you’ll never cross his path.  You might be asking yourself why an alien being would be named after an Earth animal, even one as fierce as a wolf. That’s because the word “Lobo” in this instance translates into “he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it” in the ancient Khund dialect. Turns out, his parents could not have given him a more fitting name.  Riding around the spaceways on his “space cycle,” which he named Spacehog, Lobo exhibits all the traits someone would associate with a biker in a Hell’s Angels-style motorcycle gang on Earth, from his long hair and tattoos, down to his kill or be killed attitude. There’s nothing in the galaxy that Lobo loves more than his pet dolphins, a good fight, the ladies and getting drunk in some intergalactic dive bar. Probably all in that order.  Over the years, Lobo has fought on the side of both the good guys and the bad, pretty much just drifting towards whoever pays him the most to get the job done, or which side promises him the better, bloodier fight. He’s tussled with Superman and the Justice League, and just about every superhero in the DC Universe.   For more on Lobo's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.",

So seriously, in fact, that it’s had the unfortunate side effect of putting her in danger more than a few times. Luckily, even before they were romantically involved, Superman has always been there to catch her when she falls.  Over the years, Lois has worn many hats besides that of journalist.

He didn't cause them to be evil (and doesn't appreciate you assuming so, thank you very much). Lucifer simply punished them for their own wicked actions. But, after growing tired of his day-to-day existence, the Morningstar yearned for freedom. He fatefully decided to kick out Hell's demons and damned souls and close the gates to the fiery realm.  After that, Lucifer packed his bags and moved to Los Angeles, the City of Angels. He’s been running a popular piano bar known as Lux, because who else is better suited to profit off of debauchery? During his time on Earth, the Morningstar has sparred with angels and demons, attempted to reconcile with his companion Mazikeen, and, oh yes, tried to create a new universe.  Lucifer's former position means he has to constantly grapple with the idea of destiny versus freewill. Charm and sophistication help the devil with whatever task he attempts, but can he really walk away from God's plans—whatever they may be?",

Mary Bromfield was the long-lost twin sister of Billy Batson before they were both orphaned as young children and Mary ended up in the care of the wealthy Bromfield family. Years later, after Billy had unlocked the powers found within the Rock of Eternity and become Shazam, he finally met Mary at a contest being held at the radio station where he worked, WHIZ Radio. Not long after, Mary was kidnapped for ransom money and was saved by Shazam and Captain Marvel Jr. Wondering if she could access the powers of the wizard Shazam like her brother, she uttered the magic words and she too transformed into a superhero and started adventuring as part of the Shazam Family.",

Like many of the most successful and influential people in the DC Universe, Maxwell Lord IV was born into money. His father was the CEO of a highly profitable but morally suspect pharmaceutical company, and when he killed himself upon discovering that they were releasing carcinogenic products, his surviving son resolved to put the family coffers to better use.  With the aid of an alien computer he had discovered on his own expeditions, Lord took it upon himself to establish a new Justice League of metahumans and capable vigilantes: one which would not just represent America, but function internationally. Maxwell Lord also discovered that he possessed the ability to manipulate the minds of others. Unfortunately, the use of these powers came with a deadly side effect that aggravated a brain tumor, causing him to bleed from the nose and eventually leading to his presumed death.  After the events of Flashpoint, Maxwell Lord was reset to the position of Black King of Checkmate until a tousle with his longtime rival Amanda Waller rendered him her prisoner. Now in a customized cell designed to kill him should he use his powers without Waller’s command, an unwilling Lord waits…and schemes.

But what if you had all of that, and could predict your opponent’s moves before they happened? You’d be almost undefeatable. You’d be Midnighter.   Midnighter’s life is shrouded in mystery. His name, family and childhood life are an enigma, even to him. For Midnighter, life began in captivity, where he endured heavy, constant experimentation on his body before he finally escaped. When he left, his body had been altered by implants, providing the often-violent hero with superhuman speed, resilience, durability and strength. But his greatest skill has proven to be his ability to predict a battle before it happens. His mind can run through a combat situation millions of times, literally covering every possible outcome before it even starts, allowing him to counter an adversary’s move before it’s even executed.  As an off-and-on member of Stormwatch, Midnighter has found a loose family of sorts, but so much of who he is remains a mystery. He knows he’s gay and that he has a strong desire to see justice upheld in whatever way possible. He believes that justice can be upheld through brutal or even lethal means, and he knows violence is often necessary for the greater good. But that’s all he knows about himself. Who he was, where he came from and what sort of things he once enjoyed remain secrets that may never be unlocked. Midnighter will have to either learn to accept this and move on, or continue searching for the answers—which he might not want to know.",

An expert in the field of cryogenics, Victor led a relatively normal existence. He worked diligently, but also fell in love with and eventually married a woman named Nora. Sadly, things took an unfortunate turn soon after. Nora became terminally ill, and to stop her degenerative disease from taking her life, Victor put her into suspended animation. His devotion to Nora led to his downfall.  The corporation funding Victor's work shut down his experiments and, in the process, caused a horrible accident, errantly releasing coolants in his lab that did irreparable harm to Victor's body’s chemistry. Transforming the former Dr. Fries into an ice-colored monstrosity, the coolants made it impossible for him to survive above freezing temperatures. To counteract this, Victor constructed a special, ultra-durable suit to keep his body alive and at the right temperature. He embraced his new persona and became Mr. Freeze.  Mr. Freeze is on a constant quest to bring back his beloved Nora, and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed. He wields a freeze gun and uses ice and cold to wreak havoc—mostly in Gotham and against Batman, but he'll turn his chill upon anyone standing in his way.",

However, despite the brutality and violence inflicted upon him, his will never broke and he never gave up hope. He dreamed of escape. But to escape the unescapable, he would need a miracle—so he became Mister Miracle.  In order to stop the destructive and long-waged war between New Genesis and Apokolips, the benevolent Highfather agreed to a gesture of peace: he would exchange sons with Darkseid, effectively condemning his child to the hells of Apokolips. Darkseid turned Scott over to Granny Goodness's \"Orphanage,\" where he was subjected to countless horrors and torture in an effort to destroy the goodness inside him, but Scott refused to surrender his innocence. Never physically powerful, Scott instead began training his mind—mentally distancing himself from the pain and sharpening his reason, logic and problem-solving abilities—turning him into an unparalleled and cunning thinker. When he finally made his escape, he succeeded through brain and not brawn, leaving behind the terror of Apokolips for life on Earth as the super hero Mister Miracle.  Mister Miracle shares a close and romantic relationship with his fellow New God Big Barda. The two met on Apokolips and quickly fell in love, despite their contrasting personalities. While Barda loves to fight and relishes battle, Scott is more peaceful and kind and simply wants to fit in and lead a normal life, much to Barda's chagrin. Their contrasting personalities but deep love for one another gives them one of the most unique relationships in the DC Universe.  Like all New Gods, Mister Miracle possesses beyond superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina and more. Along with his natural gifts, Mister Miracle carries a number of weapons and advanced Apokoliptian technology, including a Mother Box that can transfer energy, sense danger and life, create force fields, project shock-waves and open boom tubes for travel. He also utilizes personally modified Aero Disks that allow him to fly at speeds of over 200 mph and cling to walls and ceilings. Incredible intelligent and resourceful, Mister Miracle is most impressively known as the world's greatest escape artist, with the ability to escape from literally anything—even death.",

But while you might not be able to solve the world's problems, you can solve the problems of the people—even if it's just one at a time. At least, that’s how Michael Holt sees it, and using his genius-level intellect, dedication and perfectionism, he plans on doing exactly that as the heroic Mr. Terrific.  Growing up in a poor family, Michael Holt strived toward excellence—academically, athletically and financially. His off-the-scales intelligence coupled with his hard work and determination led to him receiving  multiple PhDs in various fields, founding one of the world's leading tech firms and becoming an Olympic gold medalist to boot. However, his commitment and drive toward perfection left him aloof and closed off from everyone but his wife. When a tragic car accident took her life, Holt found a new goal: to follow in the footsteps of his humanitarian spouse and dedicate his life to helping others and not just himself.  He joined the Justice Society of America and used his vast financial and technological resources to create the T-Sphere to aid him in his quest. These flying robot spheres respond to Holt's vocal commands and serve a multitude of functions, from passive uses like holographic projection and communication to weaponized usage through explosives and electrical charges.  However, Mr. Terrific's true strength comes from his own personal drive to overcome any obstacle and solve any problem. Unfortunately, this determination can also sometimes lead to him shutting out the rest of the world and other people until the problem is solved. Yet despite this, Holt remains dedicated to keeping the vow he made to his late wife—to solve everyone's problems.",

At the moment of this creation, the cosmic entity who would be known as the Monitor was born on the moon of Oa. At the same moment, the Monitor's twisted twin, the Anti-Monitor, was also born on the moon of Qward in the Antimatter Universe. When they discovered each other's existence, they began a war across dimensions that lasted a million years and eventually rendered them immobile for nine billion years.  When the Anti-Monitor finally awoke and launched a wave of antimatter, destroying universe after universe in the Multiverse, the Monitor also awoke. He gathered heroes and villains on his satellite home to fight his twisted doppelgänger in what became known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths. But it was not a war that the Monitor would live to see the end of. During the Crisis, his protégé, Harbinger, corrupted by the dark powers of the Anti-Monitor, murdered the Monitor.

Upon his escape from an embarrassing captivity at the hands of a mere mortal, Morpheus finds himself at a crossroads, forced to deal with the enormous changes within both himself and his realm. His journey to find his place in a world that’s drastically changed takes him through mythical worlds to retrieve his old heirlooms, the back roads of America for a twisted reunion, and even Hell itself—to receive the dubious honor of picking the next Devil.

Xebel and Atlantis were eternally at odds, and fought each other in many wars for hundreds of years. Atlantis eventually gained the upper hand, trapping Xebel in a mystical barrier that did not permit the inhabitants to leave their home, which was located in the area known to surface dwellers as the Bermuda Triangle. Ships could enter Xebel, but with few exceptions, none could leave.   For more on Nereus's history, visit his page on DCUniverse.com.",

Their populations became known as the New Gods, the immortal denizens of the cosmos who existed outside the constraints of earthly time and space.  Things were far from peaceful for the New Gods of either planet, and soon they found themselves consumed by war. The ruler of New Genesis, Highfather, eventually brokered peace with the ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid, by orchestrating an exchange of their sons. Highfather's son, Scott Free, was given over to the torture pits of Apokolips, while Darkseid's son, Orion, was released to the relative luxury of New Genesis.  The treaty lasted for a time, but sadly, Darkseid's lust for power was not so easily sated. He used the respite of peace to bolster his forces and begin his hunt for the mythical Anti-Life Equation, a weapon that would give him the power not only to destroy New Genesis, but to bend all life in the universe to his will. And after Scott Free escaped Apokolips alongside former Female Fury Big Barda to make a new home on Earth, there was nothing keeping Darkseid from mobilizing yet again.  Now Highfather's forces, led by the fleet-footed Lightray and the rage-filled Orion, must clash with Apokolips’ Granny Goodness and her Female Furies, the relentless general Steppenwolf and his Parademons and the bloodthirsty Kalibak in a race to find the Anti-Life Equation before it falls into Darkseid's hands.",

You don’t make the decisions and you don’t give orders. So, what do you do if you’re the Boy Wonder to one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and you’re looking to break out on your own?  Simple. You become Nightwing.  When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire and bat-friendly super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young boy and eventually molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew older, playing second fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him, and eventually he struck out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming into his own as a respected member of the superhero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is simple—if you’re breaking the law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short and most assuredly painful trip to Arkham.  Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do. He doesn’t want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s accomplished while avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can Nightwing be as effective as he ultimately wants to be?",

Orm is eternally jealous of his brother, known on the surface world as Aquaman, and has dedicated his life to not only taking his throne away from him—and thereby taking it for himself—but also destroying everything and everyone that he holds dear. Although they are related by blood, Orm has none of his brother’s nobility or charity, and only exhibits ruthlessness and sadism.   Although the nature of their brotherhood has changed over the decades, it seems that the two half-brothers are always destined to be at odds no matter how the universe shakes out.

Evil has never been so seductive as it is in the form of Poison Ivy, who uses her own natural pheromones to control whomever she wants. Her additional ability to control the floral life around her gives her an instant army against anyone who tries to stop her, as vines and plants attack whoever is foolish enough to get in her way.  The beautiful villainess is not a criminal in the traditional sense, but an ecoterrorist determined to push mankind out of the way, so plants can rule the planet she believes has long abused them. But Ivy has also proven herself compassionate time and time again, especially toward other women who have been victimized.  No two-dimensional villain, Ivy remains one of the most conflicted and complex members of Batman’s formidable rogues gallery.",

But as the sole witness to the reality-changing events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Psycho-Pirate has issues of his own.  The original Psycho-Pirate was an underappreciated newspaper typesetter named Charles Halstead, who longed for the world to notice him. By surreptitiously printing his messages in the paper, Halstead adopted the moniker of the Psycho-Pirate for a string of crimes designed to evoke emotional reactions of greed, hate and fear. Halstead was eventually discovered and jailed by the Justice Society of America. He shared a cellmate, a gangster by the name of Roger Hayden.  While swapping stories of their lives before prison, an aging Halstead told Hayden about a secret he’d learned in his days as the Psycho-Pirate: the existence of a set of mystical artifacts known as the Medusa Masks, which could be used to manipulate people’s emotions directly. Once Roger Hayden was free from prison, he located these masks and designed a faceplate to flip through them at will, allowing him to project whatever emotions he desired. Though he proves a more formidable foe than his predecessor, Hayden was also soundly defeated in multiple rows with the Justice Society, even when teaming up with the Ultra-Humanite’s Secret Society of Super-Villains.  In the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Psycho-Pirate’s particular abilities came in high demand. He was approached by the Monitor, who enlisted him to use his Medusa Mask to call other essential personnel to defend the universe who may otherwise be reticent to join. But it wasn’t long before Psycho-Pirate betrayed the world’s defenders to join the Anti-Monitor after being promised a world of his own in the aftermath. When the Anti-Monitor fell, the Crisis was resolved and the world was remade, Psycho-Pirate remained one of the few beings who remembered the Infinite Earths…a knowledge which drove him insane, committing him to a life in Arkham Asylum.

He is Ra’s al Ghul, the Demon’s Head, leader of the League of Assassins and the only person in the world capable of going toe-to-toe with the Bat on every level.  Ra’s al Ghul first became aware of Batman after the Dark Knight became entangled with his daughter, Talia. As another man of power who was fully committed to his cause, Ra’s al Ghul saw Batman as a worthy heir to his position as leader of the League of Assassins, a shadowy group that seeks to cleanse the world of corruption and achieve perfect environmental balance. However, the Dark Knight refused, seeing Ra’s al Ghul’s methods—such as killing half of humanity through biological warfare—too ruthless and brutal.  Utilizing the regenerative powers of the Lazarus Pit, Ra’s al Ghul can heal himself from any injury and has often been resurrected from death itself. His exact age is unknown, but he has been around for hundreds of years, giving him an immeasurable amount of knowledge and resources. He is easily one of the world’s greatest threats and can be seen as the embodiment of Batman’s desire to be more than a man, to be a symbol.

Operating for years as a closeted lesbian, Montoya was eventually outed by Two-Face, a traumatic, shocking violation that caused her deeply conservative parents to disown her. Professionally, however, it was little more than a blip and Montoya now stands alongside Gordon and Harvey Bullock as one of Gotham City's best cops and closest non-masked allies to Batman.

His exemplary military record put him on Amanda Waller’s radar, and she drafted him to lead the Suicide Squad, much like his father, Rick Flag Sr., did before him. The younger Rick accepted the new role, but he wasn’t exactly thrilled about the gig.  Leading the infamous Suicide Squad comes with a lot of baggage. Comprised entirely of criminals and super-villains, the group draws the most challenging missions where survival is almost always secondary. As a military hero, Rick doesn’t share the checkered past of many of his teammates, but is nevertheless fiercely loyal to the Squad. He’s never backed down from a conflict and he’s applied his talents as a leader, a pilot and a fighter in scrape after scrape.  A soldier through and through, Rick respects the chain of command and never fails to follow Waller’s orders. Whether he’s battling the supernatural, leading a clandestine mission or just sacrificing personal relationships in favor of the job, Rick has risen to the occasion again and again. Considering the Squad’s survival rate, that’s really saying something.",

While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavors, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.  Possessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps, and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not physically imposing, the Riddler's brilliance, neurosis and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little—if at all—about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battle against Batman.",

So OK, maybe you can’t be Batman… but that doesn’t mean you can’t be adopted by him.  And just like that, Robin the Boy Wonder made the kid sidekick an icon.  Acrobat Dick Grayson was the youngest member of his parents’ death-defying circus act. But after their cold-blooded murder, Dick vowed revenge. Seeing a genuine piece of himself in the boy, Batman took him in—and gave him a better outlet for his anger. Becoming Batman’s protégé, Robin is an expert fighter and astounding acrobat—with the toughest example in the world to live up to. But the Boy Wonder’s true strength may lie in not being Batman—and providing a beacon of hope and family throughout the Dark Knight’s grim crusade.  But as Dick matures into his own entity—eventually becoming the masked crime fighter Nightwing—Robin proves more than just an identity, but a mantle passed to the most worthy. From the troubled Jason Todd to the overachieving Tim Drake, the mask is now worn by Bruce Wayne’s own son Damian—a rebellious troublemaker who’s been trained by assassins since birth. With a lethal skill set and a marginal sense of mercy, Robin no longer needs Batman to protect him from criminals.",

However, there is another denizen of Gotham that knows how to use fear to his advantage. One that turns Batman's own weapon against him and revels in terror and dread: the Scarecrow.   As a young child, Jonathan Crane was subjected to sick and twisted experiments on fear conducted by his own father. Emotionally scarred and mentally unstable from the ordeal, Crane spent his childhood living in fear until he made an important realization—if he could control fear, it would never again control him. Over time, this interest in fear become an obsession. Graduating from college with a doctorate in psychology and specialty in phobias, Jonathan began experimenting on others, subjecting them to a hallucinogenic fear toxin he developed that brought out their worst nightmares. Although Batman has developed a number of remedies to counteract these toxins, Crane is constantly improving upon his formula, creating more potent and deadlier versions.  The Scarecrow constantly proves to be a dangerous threat to the Dark Knight not due to physical strength, but to the emotional and psychological damage his toxins can cause. In fact, Scarecrow tends to shy away from physical confrontations and instead lets his victims fall prey to their own waking nightmares. A doctor of the deadliest caliber, the Scarecrow's horrific acts don't stem from a villainous desire for power or money, but from an unbreakable urge to learn and hone his craft—mastery over fear itself.",

Among the first were Billy's sister, Mary Bromfield, who became Mary Marvel, and young Freddy Freeman, who became Captain Marvel Jr. They were eventually joined by the \"Lieutenant Marvels\"—three other boys also named Billy Batson who were nicknamed \"Tall Billy,\" \"Fat Billy\" and \"Hill Billy.\" These three could also access the powers of Shazam when they shouted the magic word in unison. The Marvel Family even had a non-super-powered member in an old man they nicknamed Uncle Dudley, who wore a homemade costume, and Mr. Tawky Tawny and Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, anthropomorphic animals who were considered honorary members.  In the post-Flashpoint reality, the Marvel Family goes by the name \"the Shazam Family\" and are all the adopted siblings of Billy Batson, raised in foster care with him by Rosa and Victor Vasquez. Once Billy gained the powers of Shazam, he eventually discovered he could share those powers with members of his new family. Now, when his siblings Darla Dudley, Eugene Choi, Mary Bromfield, Pedro Peña, and Freddy Freeman say the magic word \"Shazam,\" they too become adult superheroes. Each member of this version of the Shazam Family shares their power equally with the others, so if the six members are transformed at once, each of them gets only a fraction of the power level.",

While Batman and most of his allies operate at night, crime in Gotham City is quite different in the daytime, and so requires a different kind of crimefighter. Enter Duke Thomas—a.k.a. the Signal, the brightly colored agent of the Bat who hits the streets when the sun is out and Batman is asleep in his cave.  Duke Thomas grew up in a Gotham City that idolized the Batman, and he met his hero at a young age. When Batman vanished for a time, Duke took up with a youth movement inspired to become Robins in his absence. This “We Are Robin” group was short-lived, but Duke made an impression on Batman once the hero returned to Gotham City. He made Duke his latest partner, but promised him a different destiny than previous Robins.  Making good on his promise, Batman gave Duke a new costume and code name, and Duke became known as the Signal. Unlike most of Batman’s Gotham City allies, Duke has discovered he is a metahuman, with light-sensory powers in his eyes. Now he’s uniquely positioned to defend his city in a way that’s utterly unlike any other member of the Batman Family.",

Names like Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner are known throughout the cosmos, and following in their footsteps would be no easy task for any ring-slinging rookie. But Dearborn, Michigan’s Simon Baz was up to the challenge.  For a time, Simon Baz carried another weapon with him at all times, making certain that his trusty handgun was always at his side—a huge departure from his predecessors. While it may seem silly at first to the average person, Baz didn’t want to rely entirely on an alien weapon he didn’t fully understand and didn’t exactly trust.  After an intense trial-by-fire period, Simon Baz is now permanently assigned to Earth’s sector as its representative Green Lantern along with his partner, Jessica Cruz.

Stagg made his fortune as an inventor and the founder of Stagg Industries, one of the world's leading tech companies. Due to the tragic loss of his wife, Stagg is wildly overprotective of his daughter, Sapphire. He was less than thrilled when she fell in love with Rex Mason, a rough-and-tumble former Stagg employee turned adventurer. Stagg’s response to their relationship with alter all of their lives forever.  Stagg had ordered Java—a genetically altered Neanderthal man who served as Stagg’s servant and bodyguard—to murder Mason while the two of them were on a mission for him. However, Mason was exposed to the mystical Orb of Ra while dying, causing him to transform into the freakish-looking hero Metamorpho.  Despite his grotesque appearance, Sapphire stayed devoted to Mason. This infuriated Simon, as he had hoped Rex's disfigurement would break the couple up. Instead, the two grew closer. Stagg continued trying to sabotage his daughter's relationship, though he eventually sought to make amends by attempting to cure Mason of his condition. Ultimately, he was unsuccessful, but when Metamorpho saved Stagg's life from an enemy bent on killing him, he finally gave his daughter and Rex his full blessing and the couple married.  Yet, if anyone expected this change of heart to extend to the way Stagg does business, they’re likely disappointed. He remains as ruthless, cold and calculating as ever.

After all, as far as Sinestro is concerned, everything he does is for the good of the universe.  Originally hailing from the planet Korugar, Sinestro once served as the Green Lantern of Sector 1417 and quickly gained recognition among the Corps for his ability to police his sector. However, peace came at a price. Sinestro's determination to preserve order caused him to act more as a dictator than a protector, conquering his own home planet in the process. Control became his means to an end, the true path to order in both his sector and the universe as a whole, and Sinestro did anything necessary to achieve it. It wasn't until then new recruit Hal Jordan learned of Sinestro's methods that the Guardians were informed and Sinestro was ejected from the Corps.  Steadfast in his belief of moral superiority and methods of maintaining order, Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, harnessing the yellow energy of fear, to not only combat the Guardians, whom he sees as the main obstacle on the path to intergalactic peace, but to also strengthen the Green Lantern Corps. For it is Sinestro’s opinion that the Green Lanterns have long since been held back by their creators.  Highly intelligent with an almost unbreakable will, Thaal Sinestro will do anything to achieve control and thereby order—control over his emotions, control over others, and even control over the entire universe.",

A typical nerdy high school student with a passion for science and pop culture, Hawkins's life changed dramatically after he got caught up in a local gang war and was doused with an experimental chemical that contained a mutagen agent. This led to him gaining a variety of electromagnetic powers, and as a big fan of comic books, Hawkins decided to use his powers to help clean up his community and save the innocent. A fun, humorous individual in his normal life, these aspects of Hawkins’s personality shine in his superhero persona as well, and Static is well known for his witty banter and good-heartedness.  Static's powers allow him to control all sorts of electromagnetic phenomena. Beyond the ability to generate electricity—which allows him to shock enemies, generate electrical force fields for protection, and create static saucers he can ride as transportation—he can also magnetize objects and cause people or objects to stick to one another through a strong static cling. In truth, even Hawkins himself is unaware of the true extent of his powers, but he will forever dedicate them to the forces of good and the protection of his friends and family.",

Forever grateful, John Henry paid it forward when the city’s protector died. He took up the fight to protect the innocent in Superman’s name, wearing his iconic “S” shield in tribute.  Irons used his scientific genius to construct a suit of armor that allowed him to fly and gave him superior strength. He also created a giant metal hammer in homage to his namesake, the African-American folk hero John Henry. Now a permanent member of Superman’s extended family, Steel is living proof that everyone has it in them to become a Superman.",

That’s a whole other level of awkward.  Stephanie Brown’s father, Arthur Brown, spent most of Stephanie’s childhood in prison for crimes he committed as the Cluemaster—a second-rate version of the Riddler who could never quite make a name for himself. When he was finally released, claiming he’d been “rehabilitated,” he jumped right back into the super-villain game with no regard for the safety or stability of his family. So, Steph decided to take things into her own hands and “spoil” her father’s schemes. She crafted a superhero identity for herself, the Spoiler, and began working to sabotage the Cluemaster behind his back, leaking info about his plans to Batman, Robin and even the Gotham City Police, intent on putting her father back behind bars for good.  But what started as a mission became her passion: Stephanie fell in love with the superhero lifestyle and the people she met. Growing stronger as Spoiler became Steph’s number-one goal, and she was successful, ultimately becoming Batman’s fourth Robin as well as one of the young women to operate under the name of Batgirl—a moniker she still uses today. Headstrong, outgoing and upbeat, Stephanie’s quick to make friends and unwilling to take no for an answer.",

After being rescued from the wreckage by the princess Diana, Steve was put to the task of winning the trust of the Amazons—something much easier said than done, considering their complete isolation from the world outside their magical borders. But luckily for him, Diana was inspired by Steve’s bravery and compassion, enough to vouch for him against her sisters’ natural misgivings.  Though he has no super powers or mythical weapons of his own, Steve’s strength and courage in the face of danger have proven him to be a consummate soldier and occasional spy, saving his squad and the nation more times than we can count. All the while, he’s been an invaluable ally for Diana, both in her civilian life and in her super heroic duties as Wonder Woman, serving as her entry point and frequent guide through the strange and unpredictable world of humankind…and, on occasion, much, much more.",

The roster has included Deadshot, a precise marksman and assassin; Harley Quinn, a peppy but psychotic villain; Captain Boomerang, the man who turns boomerangs into lethal weapons; Enchantress, a powerful sorceress who can wield magical energy; and their sometimes field leader Rick Flag, an elite soldier who is one of the only members who isn’t a super-villain.

Born into the highest echelon of the ancient and patriarchal League of Assassins, Talia could have had all the power in the world if not for the unfortunate happenstance of being born a woman.  A peerless fighter and martial artist who possesses a keen mind for both strategy and tactics, Talia was nonetheless led to believe that the only way to secure the power lost to her by birth was to find a suitable male partner and produce a son. Yet, having accomplished both romance with her ideal man and the birth of a perfect heir, Talia was still left wanting. It was not until the Demon’s Daughter took her destiny into her own hands, forming the clandestine criminal empire known as Leviathan, that Talia al Ghul at last became something more powerful than even her venerable father could imagine.",

Each of them redefined the word \"hero.\"  The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. The most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.  In the 1940s, college student Jay Garrick acquired his super-speed abilities in a random lab accident and became the first DC Super Hero to go by the name the Flash. Years later, Jay was succeeded by police scientist Barry Allen, until Barry’s former kid partner Wally West took up the mantle at a time when Barry was considered dead. But, when Barry returned, he became the Flash once again. All three generations of speedsters have been cornerstone members of both the Justice Society and Justice League.  The Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and he has often used his powers to travel though different eras and even into other dimensions. Although the Flash has not always been fast enough to outrun personal tragedy when it has come for him, he always does his best to prevent the same from happening to the people of Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he's earned himself a spot among the greatest Super Heroes the DC Universe has ever known.",

A complete psychopath with no moral compass whatsoever, the Joker, whose real name and identity remain completely unknown, is characterized by his chalk-white skin, green hair and a permanent rictus grin stretched across his face. But there isn’t a single thing funny about this particular clown, who only finds humor in the suffering of others.  The Joker first appeared in Gotham City around the same time that the Batman arrived on the scene, and since their very first confrontation, the Clown Prince of Crime has been the Dark Knight’s most formidable nemesis. While Batman represents justice and order, the Joker is his complete opposite, seeing himself as an agent of chaos, the living embodiment of the cruel randomness of fate. The Joker’s psychosis causes his personality to shift between goofy prankster and mass murderer on a dime, making it impossible to predict his next move. It’s this unpredictability that really makes him such a dangerous opponent.  Certainly, no villain has managed to inflict as much pain and suffering on Batman as the Joker, who has on more than one occasion brought death to Bruce Wayne’s extended family. As long as there is a Batman bringing justice to Gotham City, there will be a Joker to bring nightmares.",

Almost as soon as Anissa made her heroic debut, she was recruited by Arsenal to join the newly re-formed Outsiders, a team her father had been a founding member of under the leadership of Batman. Although Thunder got along with most of her teammates, she instantly butted heads with the metahuman powerhouse known as Grace Choi. Eventually, the squabbling pair developed a mutual attraction to one another and began dating, forming an enduring relationship that remains aspirational to many to this day.",

A self-made hero in every sense of the word, Tim took on the role of Robin after attempting to convince Dick Grayson to become Batman’s sidekick again following the death of Jason Todd. In Tim's mind, Batman needed a Robin to stay true to himself and his mission. Although Tim didn't intend to take up the mantle for himself, he was more than happy to do what needed to be done.  Analytical almost to a fault, Tim represents the \"brains\" of the Batman Family's roster of onetime Robins.

A prominent and well-educated District Attorney, Harvey Dent fought valiantly to uphold the law and make the city a better place. In any other city, it would have worked.

For Vandal Savage, immortality means achieving power by plotting the downfall of humankind to advance his own self-interests—and that makes him one of the most dangerous beings on Earth.  Born before recorded history, Vandal Savage encountered a radioactive meteorite that granted him enhanced speed, strength and agility, increased his intelligence beyond the capabilities of the average human—and gifted him immortality. For 50,000 years, Savage roamed and attempted to rule the Earth, claiming direct involvement in some of history's most notorious moments, from the rise and fall of the Roman Empire to the gruesome murders committed by Jack the Ripper.  With the rise of super heroes, Savage found a new challenge, a new obstacle in what he perceived as his rightful place as the ruler of Earth. From the Justice Society of America to the Justice League to many of his fellow super-villains, Savage will face down and eliminate anyone who poses a threat to his supremacy—and has thousands of years of experience and planning to pull it off.  Along with his enhanced physical abilities, Savage's intelligence makes him an almost-unparalleled tactician and strategist. Savage's immortality not only grants him the ability to survive just about anything, but also has allowed him to amass incredible wealth, resources, knowledge and experience. Without question, Savage ranks as one of the most dangerous beings on Earth...past, present or future.",

As a woman working in the fields of medicine and business, Veronica Cale spent her life fighting an uphill battle against sexism. As gifted and insightful as she was, she had to work ten times as hard as everyone else in the room to make half the progress. But Cale was up to the challenge, fighting all odds to become the founder of a highly successful pharmaceutical company. Out of necessity, Veronica Cale developed a callousness which allowed her to survive in a cutthroat world. So, when Wonder Woman arrived in man’s world with her gods-given gifts preaching the peace and harmony which had always been denied to Cale, the businesswoman took it as a personal offense.  Cale would go on to launch Godwatch, which was founded for the purpose of locating Themyscira. But as Wonder Woman discovered, the reason was not to enhance Cale’s own power or influence, but out of desperation. Phobos and Deimos, the sons of the war god Ares, had exploited Cale into leading this expedition by placing a curse on Isadore, her only daughter, which removed her face and soul from her body. Only upon the liberation of Ares from his prison on Paradise Island could Isadore be restored.  Cale exacted vengeance upon her blackmailers by allying with the sorceress Circe, who transformed each of them into her own hounds. But as Veronica learned when she located Paradise Island, Isadore could only remain whole if she was left there. Forced to leave her only daughter behind, Veronica blames Wonder Woman’s personal feud with Ares for their separation to this day. And as the canine Phobos and Deimos know well, Veronica Cale is not a woman who will be denied her revenge.",

At first, he ignored the calling of a hero and instead became the leader of a local street gang called “Los Lobos.” But when the original JLA disbanded and was later reformed and set up shop in his hometown, Ramon took on the codename Vibe and joined the team, where he quickly earned the respect of veteran Leaguers like Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter.  Although his time with the League was brief, Vibe proved himself a true hero and was fondly remembered by his teammates after he was killed in action. Yet fittingly, Vibe’s history was itself shaken up (in this case by the events of Flashpoint). Today, Vibe lives again. He’s learned that he gained his powers when he was caught in the event horizon of a Boom Tube during an invasion from Apokolips and interdimensional forces rewrote his DNA. This allows him to not only create powerful vibrations, but also to create interdimensional portals enabling Cisco to save lives anywhere in the multiverse.

And second, for every “zombie” he ushers towards oblivion, a new accounting is made by the edge of that knife upon his own skin.

Vigilante is a one man judge, jury and executioner, targeting lawbreakers who have evaded prosecution. The only due process he’s interested in is his collection of firearms—just ask the body of criminals he’s left behind.  Adrian Chase was once a hotshot district attorney and the job gave him a firsthand look at how criminals manipulate loopholes in the justice system. He soon grew disillusioned with the law and began bending the rules in his quest to prosecute the Scarapelli criminal empire. Scarapelli retaliated by detonating a bomb in the Chases’ home, killing Adrian’s wife and children. Realizing he couldn’t bring Scarapelli to justice as DA, Adrian adopted the identity of Vigilante and took matters into his own hands.  As Vigilante, Adrian Chase stalks the criminal underworld, but his quest for vengeance has taken a toll on him. The increasingly lethal nature of his career weighs on Adrian, who has begun to feel that Vigilante is doing just as much damage as the criminals he is hunting. Inspired by Chase’s mission, multiple men and women have taken up the Vigilante mantle over the years, with varying degrees of success. Still, with a criminal justice system that continues to let far too many privileged wrongdoers off the hook, it’s clear that Vigilante isn’t going anywhere. As long as there is crime going unpunished, he’ll be there delivering his own violent brand of justice.",

The strengths, abilities and attributes of the entire animal kingdom are at the beck and call of Mari McCabe—who channels these powers through a magical family heirloom to battle those who would harm the natural world as the super hero Vixen.  As a child, Mari saw the greed and corruption that she fights against lead to the deaths of her parents. Later, Mari discovered that the mysterious Tantu Totem—the powerful necklace she inherited from her parents—granted her the ability to take on the attributes of every animal on Earth. She could fly like a hawk, breathe underwater like a fish and even strengthen her skin to the protective levels of a rhinoceros. Adopting the moniker Vixen, Mari seeks to protect and defend all innocents, humans and animals alike.  Although short-tempered and sometimes overly self-righteous, Mari possesses compassion that gives her a strong and unwavering moral compass. Beyond her role as a super hero, she is a model and animal-rights activist, allowing her to use both aspects of her life to protect from humanity those creatures unable to protect themselves. Throughout her career as Vixen, she's fought along some of the greatest heroes in the DC Universe and has even served as a member of the Justice League.",

It’s the only graphic novel to make Time’s 100 Best Novels list, one of Entertainment Weekly’s Top 50 novels of the past 25 years, and has made fans of everyone from film directors Zack Snyder and Darren Aronofsky to the writers on Lost.  Watchmen takes place in an alternate world where the mere presence of American superheroes changed history: The US won the Vietnam War, Nixon is still president, and the cold war is in full effect.  It begins with a murder-mystery before unfolding into a planet-altering conspiracy: When a retired hero is killed, his former teammates must investigate. The conspiracy they uncover will entwine their secret traumas and twisted psychologies, ultimately asking where the fine line is drawn between heroes and villains?  Popularly cited as the point where comics came of age, Watchmen’s sophisticated take on superheroes has been universally acclaimed for its psychological depth and realism. It’s slowly and inevitably become it’s own franchise, spawning a movie, video game, and the Before Watchmen prequel comics.",

Those that haven't experienced this sort of loss will never become greater than they are. Many heroes had these tragedies happen at a young age or in the early days of their careers. But for those who haven't, one man makes it his duty to break them down in order to make them better, even if he has to force their tragedy himself: Zoom.  Hunter Zolomon's life was riddled by brutal tragedies. As a child, he discovered his father was a serial killer who also murdered Hunter's mother after she tried to stop him. This tragedy inspired Hunter to study psychology and criminology, and to join the FBI; but a miscalculation during a case led to the death of his father-in-law. Then, things took a turn for the truly dark after an attack by Gorilla Grodd left Hunter paralyzed. He begged his friend the Flash to go back in time and prevent the attack from happening—and the Flash refused.  Taking matters into his own hands, Hunter attempted to go back in time himself, leading to an accidental explosion, another tragedy—but one that made him more than what he was. Gaining the ability of perceived super-speed and adopting the name Zoom, Hunter dedicated his life to making sure people experienced their own personal tragedy in order to make them better heroes—starting with the Flash.  Zoom is utterly unlike the Flash and other speedsters, both setting him apart and making him one of the most dangerous and challenging of Flash’s foes. His speed doesn’t come from the Speed Force, but from altering his own relative time, slowing or speeding up the world around him, allowing him to run even faster than the Flash. His warped sense of heroism and villainy has led Zoom to continuously threaten not only those closest to the Flash but also countless heroes throughout the DC Universe. But really, he's just trying to make them better…by any means necessary.",
